  #### Managing Chef Server
  Check out the [Manage the Chef
  Server](http://docs.chef.io/server/#manage-the-chef-server)
  documentation provided by OpsCode for more information about managing users,
  keys, and clients. If this is your first time using Chef Server 12,
  instructions for adding users and organizations via command line can be
  found [here](http://docs.chef.io/server/server_orgs.html). For security
  purposes, we have disabled user setup and signup via the web interface.

  #### Logging In via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
